This is the replayer with RLE support I used in RATillery[1]. It is an adaptation
of the PLAYER.ASM included with MONOTONE.

Changes:
 - RLE decompression
 - Supports multiple songs
 - Use NASM syntax

API:
 - playSong: Start playing song (AL = song_id, AH = loop?)
 - stopSong: Stop current song
 - muteSong: Mutes music if AL != 0 (useful to stop music during game effects)

RLE compressor (pitcomp.c):
 - Takes PIT files as dumped by CTRL+W from MONOTONE.
